This group project was made using React and Firebase.
The idea of the website is that Shabora global is a agency that received an assigment by a company to create a website where the employees of a company can receive a daily joke, submit a daily joke and vote on the submitted jokes. 
The website makes a call to an API to receive the daily joke.
Users can submit a daily joke. The joke gets stored in Firebase and through firebase we display the user, department and joke on the UX. 
Users can vote on a joke and can find a graphic that gives the user a quick view on the data collected on the joke. 
The most populair joke gets to be displayed on the landingpage. The index of the joke will change based on the value of the joke. The value of the joke can change, based on the amount of votes the joke has received.
